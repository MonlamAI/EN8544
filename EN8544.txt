Welcome to my world
Some say it's a simple place
Well that may be so
But at least, there's always a smile on my face

Welcome to my world
It's a world full of joy
It's a world full of love
The world to me now is just one big toy

If ever you're feeling low
If ever you have no place to go
I'll always welcome you to my world
That's something you should know

Welcome to my world
It's a world free of hate
It's a world free of wars
So please don't hesitate
To come and visit my world
